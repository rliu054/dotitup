" ### junegunn/vim-easy-align
" Allows for easy alignment of text
"
" From:
" ```ruby
" {
"   hello: "there",
"   foo: "bar",
"   name: "Jameel"
" }
" ```
"
" To:
" ```ruby
" {
"   hello: "there",
"   foo:   "bar",
"   name:  "Jameel"
" }
" ```
"
" In this case, highlight the related lines and press `ga:`
" `ga` activates the easy-align plugin, and 
" then `:` tells it to align on the `:` character.
"
" Probably best to visit https://github.com/junegunn/vim-easy-align for full usage.
